/**
 * Abstract base class for mapping classes.
 *
 * The interface for filling the tables of FEValues is provided. Everything
 * else has to happen in derived classes.
 *
 * The following paragraph applies to the implementation of FEValues. Usage of
 * the class is as follows: first, call the functions @p update_once and @p
 * update_each with the update flags you need. This includes the flags needed
 * by the FiniteElement. Then call <tt>get_*_data</tt> and with the or'd
 * results.  This will initialize and return some internal data structures. On
 * the first cell, call <tt>fill_fe_*_values</tt> with the result of @p
 * update_once. Finally, on each cell, use <tt>fill_fe_*_values</tt> with the
 * result of @p update_each to compute values for a special cell.
 *
 * <h3>Mathematics of the mapping</h3>
 *
 * The mapping is a transformation $\mathbf x = \Phi(\mathbf{\hat x})$ which
 * maps the reference cell [0,1]<sup>dim</sup> to the actual grid cell in
 * R<sup>spacedim</sup>. In order to describe the application of the mapping
 * to different objects, we introduce the notation for the Jacobian
 * $J(\mathbf{\hat x}) = \nabla\Phi(\mathbf{\hat x})$. For instance, if
 * dim=spacedim=2, we have
 * @f[
 * J(\mathbf{\hat x}) = \left(\begin{matrix}
 * \frac{\partial x}{\partial \hat x} & \frac{\partial x}{\partial \hat y}
 * \\
 * \frac{\partial y}{\partial \hat x} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial \hat y}
 * \end{matrix}\right)
 * @f]
 *
 * <h4>Mapping of functions</h4>
 *
 * Functions are simply mapped such that
 * @f[
 * u(\mathbf x) = u\bigl(\Phi(\mathbf{\hat x})\bigr)
 * = \hat u(\mathbf{\hat x}).
 * @f]
 * Since finite element shape functions are usually defined on the reference
 * cell, nothing needs to be done for them. For a function defined on the
 * computational domain, the quadrature points need to be mapped, which is
 * done in fill_fe_values() if @p update_quadrature_points is set in the
 * update flags. The mapped quadrature points are then accessed through
 * FEValuesBase::quadrature_point().
 *
 * @todo Add a function <tt>transform_quadrature_points</tt> for this.
 *
 * <h4>Mapping of integrals</h4>
 *
 * The volume form $d\hat x$ is mapped such that for a grid cell <i>Z</i>
 * @f[
 *  \int_Z u(\mathbf x)\,d\mathbf x = \int_{\hat Z} \hat
 * u(\mathbf{\hat x}) \left|\text{det}J(\mathbf{\hat x})\right|
 * \,d\mathbf{\hat x}.
 * @f]
 *
 * The transformed quadrature weights $\left|\text{det}J(\mathbf{\hat
 * x})\right|$ are accessed through FEValuesBase::JxW() and computed in
 * fill_fe_values(), if @p update_JxW_values is set in the update flags.
 *
 * @todo Add a function <tt>transform_quadrature_weights</tt> for this.
 *
 * @todo Add documentation on the codimension-one case
 *
 * <h4>Mapping of vector fields, differential forms and gradients of vector
 * fields</h4>
 *
 * The transformation of vector fields, differential forms
 * (gradients/jacobians) and gradients of vector fields between the reference
 * cell and the actual grid cell follows the general form
 *
 * @f[
 * \mathbf v(\mathbf x) = \mathbf A(\mathbf{\hat x})
 * \mathbf{\hat v}(\mathbf{\hat x}),
 * \qquad
 * \mathbf T(\mathbf x) = \mathbf A(\mathbf{\hat x})
 * \mathbf{\hat T}(\mathbf{\hat x}) \mathbf B(\mathbf{\hat x}),
 * @f]
 *
 * where <b>v</b> is a vector field or a differential form and and <b>T</b> a
 * tensor field of gradients. The differential forms <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> are
 * determined by the MappingType enumerator. These transformations are
 * performed through the functions transform(). See the documentation there
 * for possible choices.
 *
 * <h3>Technical notes</h3>
 *
 * A hint to implementors: no function except the two functions @p
 * update_once and @p update_each may add any flags.
 *
 * For more information about the <tt>spacedim</tt> template parameter check
 * the documentation of FiniteElement or the one of Triangulation.

  /**
   * Base class for internal data of mapping objects. The
   * internal mechanism is that upon construction of a FEValues object, it
   * asks the mapping and finite element classes that are to be used to
   * allocate memory for their own purpose in which they may store data that
   * only needs to be computed once. For example, most finite elements will
   * store the values of the shape functions at the quadrature points in this
   * object, since they do not change from cell to cell and only need to be
   * computed once. The same may be true for Mapping classes that want to
   * only evaluate the shape functions used for mapping once at the quadrature
   * points.
   *
   * Since different FEValues objects using different
   * quadrature rules might access the same mapping object at the same
   * time, it is necessary to create one such object per FEValues object.
   * FEValues does this by calling Mapping::get_data(), or in reality the
   * implementation of the corresponding function in derived classes.
   * Ownership of the object created by Mapping::get_data() is then transferred
   * to the FEValues object,
   * but a reference to this object is passed to the mapping object every
   * time it is asked to compute information on a concrete cell. This
   * happens when FEValues::reinit() (or the corresponding classes in
   * FEFaceValues and FESubfaceValues) call Mapping::fill_fe_values()
   * (and similarly via Mapping::fill_fe_face_values() and
   * Mapping::fill_fe_subface_values()).
   *
   * The purpose of this class is for mapping objects to store information
   * that can be computed once at the beginning, on the reference cell,
   * and to access it later when computing information on a concrete cell.
   * As such, the object handed to Mapping::fill_fe_values() is marked as
   * <code>const</code>, because the assumption is that at the time this
   * information is used, it will not need to modified again. However,
   * classes derived from Mapping can also use such objects for two other
   * purposes:
   *
   * - To provide scratch space for computations that are done in
   *   Mapping::fill_fe_values() and similar functions. Some of the
   *   derived classes would like to use scratch arrays and it would
   *   be a waste of time to allocate these arrays every time this
   *   function is called, just to de-allocate it again at the end
   *   of the function. Rather, one could allocate this memory once
   *   as a member variable of the current class, and simply use
   *   it in Mapping::fill_fe_values().
   * - After calling Mapping::fill_fe_values(), FEValues::reinit()
   *   calls FiniteElement::fill_fe_values() where the finite element
   *   computes values, gradients, etc of the shape functions using
   *   both information computed once at the beginning using a mechanism
   *   similar to the one described here (see FiniteElement::InternalDataBase)
   *   as well as the data already computed by Mapping::fill_fe_values().
   *   As part of its work, some implementations of
   *   FiniteElement::fill_fe_values() need to transform shape function
   *   data, and they do so by calling Mapping::transform(). The call
   *   to the latter function also receives a reference to the
   *   Mapping::InternalDataBase object. Since Mapping::transform()
   *   may be called many times on each cell, it is sometimes worth
   *   for derived classes to compute some information only once
   *   in Mapping::fill_fe_values() and reuse it in
   *   Mapping::transform(). This information can also be stored in
   *   the classes that derived mapping classes derive from
   *   InternalDataBase.
   *
   * In both of these cases, the InternalDataBase object being passed
   * around is "morally const", i.e., no external observer can tell
   * whether a scratch array or some intermediate data for
   * Mapping::transform() is being modified by Mapping::fill_fe_values()
   * or not. Consequently, the InternalDataBase objects are always
   * passed around as <code>const</code> objects. Derived classes
   * that would like to make use of the two additional uses outlined
   * above therefore need to mark the member variables they want to
   * use for these purposes as <code>mutable</code> to allow for their
   * modification despite the fact that the surrounding object is
   * marked as <code>const</code>.

  /**
   * Compute information about the mapping from the reference cell
   * to the real cell indicated by the first argument to this function.
   * Derived classes will have to implement this function based on the
   * kind of mapping they represent. It is called by FEValues::reinit().
   *
   * Conceptually, this function's represents the application of the
   * mapping $\mathbf x=\mathbf F_K(\hat {\mathbf x})$ from reference
   * coordinates $\mathbf\in [0,1]^d$ to real space coordinates
   * $\mathbf x$ for a given cell $K$. Its purpose is to compute the following
   * kinds of data:
   *
   * - Data that results from the application of the mapping itself, e.g.,
   *   computing the location $\mathbf x_q = \mathbf F_K(\hat{\mathbf x}_q)$
   *   of quadrature points on the real cell, and that is directly useful
   *   to users of FEValues, for example during assembly.
   * - Data that is necessary for finite element implementations to compute
   *   their shape functions on the real cell. To this end, the
   *   FEValues::reinit() function calls FiniteElement::fill_fe_values()
   *   after the current function, and the output of this function serves
   *   as input to FiniteElement::fill_fe_values(). Examples of
   *   information that needs to be computed here for use by the
   *   finite element classes is the Jacobian of the mapping,
   *   $\hat\nabla \mathbf F_K(\hat{\mathbf x})$ or its inverse,
   *   for example to transform the gradients of shape functions on
   *   the reference cell to the gradients of shape functions on
   *   the real cell.
   *
   * The information computed by this function is used to fill the various
   * member variables of the output argument of this function. Which of
   * the member variables of that structure should be filled is determined
   * by the update flags stored in the Mapping::InternalDataBase object
   * passed to this function.
   *
   * @param[in] cell The cell of the triangulation for which this function
   *   is to compute a mapping from the reference cell to.
   * @param[in] cell_similarity Whether or not the cell given as first
   *   argument is simply a translation, rotation, etc of the cell for
   *   which this function was called the most recent time. This
   *   information is computed simply by matching the vertices (as stored
   *   by the Triangulation) between the previous and the current cell.
   *   The value passed here may be modified by implementations of
   *   this function and should then be returned (see the discussion of the
   *   return value of this function).
   * @param[in] quadrature A reference to the quadrature formula in use
   *   for the current evaluation. This quadrature object is the same
   *   as the one used when creating the @p internal_data object. The
   *   object is used both to map the location of quadrature points,
   *   as well as to compute the JxW values for each quadrature
   *   point (which involves the quadrature weights).
   * @param[in] internal_data A reference to an object previously
   *   created by get_data() and that may be used to store information
   *   the mapping can compute once on the reference cell. See the
   *   documentation of the Mapping::InternalDataBase class for an
   *   extensive description of the purpose of these objects.
   * @param[out] output_data A reference to an object whose member
   *   variables should be computed. Not all of the members of this
   *   argument need to be filled; which ones need to be filled is
   *   determined by the update flags stored inside the
   *   @p internal_data object.
   * @return An updated value of the @p cell_similarity argument to
   *   this function. The returned value will be used for the corresponding
   *   argument when FEValues::reinit() calls
   *   FiniteElement::fill_fe_values(). In most cases, derived classes will
   *   simply want to return the value passed for @p cell_similarity.
   *   However, implementations of this function may downgrade the
   *   level of cell similarity. This is, for example, the case for
   *   classes that take not only into account the locations of the
   *   vertices of a cell (as reported by the Triangulation), but also
   *   other information specific to the mapping. The purpose is that
   *   FEValues::reinit() can compute whether a cell is similar to the
   *   previous one only based on the cell's vertices, whereas the
   *   mapping may also consider displacement fields (e.g., in the
   *   MappingQ1Eulerian and MappingFEField classes). In such cases,
   *   the mapping may conclude that the previously computed
   *   cell similarity is too optimistic, and invalidate it for
   *   subsequent use in FiniteElement::fill_fe_values() by
   *   returning a less optimistic cell similarity value.
